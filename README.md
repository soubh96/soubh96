## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hello! I'm **Soubhik Baral**, a scientist at **Central Research Laboratory (CRL-BEL)**, specializing in **embedded systems**, **networking**, and **software development**. I have a deep interest in developing innovative solutions for real-world challenges, particularly in IoT and wireless communication.

When I'm not working on projects, I enjoy **playing football**, which helps me refresh my mind and stay energized. It's my way of balancing the mental rigor of research with physical activity, helping me stay focused and motivated. Whether it's diving into the latest tech trends or enjoying a quick football match with friends, I strive to keep a healthy balance between work and play.

Feel free to connect with me if you're interested in tech innovations, research collaborations, or just a fun football chat!
